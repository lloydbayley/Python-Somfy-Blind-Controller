# Somfy Blind Controller

Code that I have cobbled-together to send signals to a hardwired Somfy Telis 4 remote.
It is by no-means a professional job but it works for me and I thought I would share it.

This project is working in my system and performs wonderfully.

I am aware that the documentation is not-yet written but I'm getting there.
The code is pretty self-evident but I need to document how I wired the remote.

This will happen shortly.
